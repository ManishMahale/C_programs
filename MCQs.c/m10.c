/*
.The main function is defined with a return type of void, indicating that it does not return a value.
.The variable x is declared and assigned the value 5.
.The 'if' statement is used to evaluate the condition x < 1.
.Since the value of x is 5, 
 the condition x < 1 evaluates to false.
.Immediately following the 'if' statement, 
 there is a semicolon ;. This semicolon creates an empty statement, 
 which is not associated with the 'if' statement.
.The printf function is encountered after the 'if' statement, 
 and it is not part of the 'if' block.
.The printf function prints "Hello" to the console.
.The execution of the program is complete.
